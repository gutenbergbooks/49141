A TRIP TO STYFORD


You have all heard of the three little pigs. And you know all about how
Old Mother Pig sent them forth to seek their fortunes, don't you? Of
course you do!

You remember, too, how the Wandering Wolf frightened the one in the
straw house and "ate up that poor little pig." And you will never
forget how he afterwards scared the one in the wooden house and "ate up
_that_ poor little pig." And then, were you ever so glad, in all your
life, as when he tried and tried and simply could not get the third
little pig--that cunning, curly-tailed, squeaky-voiced little pig who
lived in the little brick house!

Well, of course, this last little pig, whose name was Grunty, lived
safely in her neat little red brick house for many years after the day
when she ate up the Wandering Wolf for her dinner.

Some years after that day of feasting, Grunty Pig had two wee piggies
of her own. The older one was white all over, except for his two black
ears, so Mother Grunty at once named him Blacky-ears. The younger one
looked just as his mother had looked when she was little--white all
over, with a curly tail and a squeaky voice so cheery that everyone
smiled when he spoke. He was called Little-wee Pig.

One day in June Mother Grunty thought she must go on a journey, and she
worried about leaving Blacky-ears and Little-wee Pig alone, for she had
not forgotten that the Wandering Wolves were not all dead and that one
of them might get after her babies.

"Come here, piglets," she called from her kitchen window.

"All right, Mother, I'm coming," answered Little-wee Pig as he jumped
from his swing and ran to the house.

But not so Blacky-ears! And I'll tell you why. Bad Boy Mischief, you
remember, is always after everyone; little children, little bears, and
little pigs. Blacky-ears, I am sorry to say, had been very friendly
with him. So, as soon as Bad Boy Mischief heard Mother Grunty call, he
hopped right onto Blacky's shoulder and whispered in his ear.

And what do you suppose? Blacky-ears listened and answered his mother
just as Bad Boy Mischief had told him to! "Aw, wait a minute, can't
you?" he grumbled!

When Mother Grunty called the second time, Blacky-ears managed to jerk
himself into the house and stand sulkily beside her chair. Then she
told the two piggies of her plan.

"Now," said Mother Grunty, "I find that I must go to Styford at once. I
fear to leave you here alone, for I too well remember what happened to
my two brothers. So, if you'll promise to be very, very good, you may
go with me."

"Oh goody, goody!" sang Little-wee Pig, dancing around his mother's
chair.

"Hurrah for some fun!" cried Blacky-ears.

"You will promise to be good, my dears?" said Mother Grunty anxiously.

"Oh yes, Mother, we'll be good," answered Little-wee Pig.

"You bet!" cried Blacky-ears.

So everything was hustle and bustle in the little brick house, for
Mother Grunty was very neat. And everything must be made tidy and not
one speck of dust must be left behind. But finally, on the third day,
came the time to go.

Blacky-ears, dressed in his new blue suit with its shiny brass buttons,
and wearing his little round cap set straight between his ears, looked
as neat as a new pin. And Little-wee Pig, all in white except for his
bright red sailor tie, was attractive too. But you should have seen the
charming Mother Grunty in her trim black suit and sailor hat to match!
Then you would have said, "Isn't she splendid!"

On the train everyone was happy, for even in that short ride there were
many interesting sights. And Mother Grunty was ever so patient about
explaining.

"Let's play 'I Spy,'" cried Blacky-ears.

"I mean, tell what we can spy out of the window. Whoever sees a thing
first can say 'I spy.' Watch sharply! Oh, I spy a tall pine tree on a
hill."

"I spy a tiny brook," called Little-wee Pig.

"Styford! Styford!" called the brakeman. And what a hustle to slip into
wraps and gather up bundles!

Styford was a busy city, and Mother Grunty was very nervous. Such a
hurrying and so much noise! It seemed to the three country pigs that
they could never cross the main street!

"Take my hands, my dears," Mother Grunty urged anxiously. At the first
crossing they did so. But soon Blacky-ears became used to the noise and
hurry. Before he knew it, Bad Boy Mischief was once more riding on his
shoulder.

"You're too old to take anyone's hand. You're smart enough to take care
of yourself," he whispered.

And Blacky-ears listened. He jerked his hand out of his mother's and
ran across the street. A large red hose wagon clanged out of the side
street and just missed knocking him flat!

"Oh-h!" shrieked Mother Grunty as she hurried to catch him. "Why will
you do such things? You promised me you would be so good. I fear you'll
come to some bad end."

But that was only the beginning of the trouble. In the "Piggie and
Wiggie" shop Blacky-ears bumped rudely against a case of glass dishes,
jarring two of them to the floor, where they broke to slivers.

While his poor mother was helping the clerk clean up the scattered
glass, Blacky-ears pried open her purse and sent the change jingling to
the floor. Poor Mother Grunty! She was almost ready to give up!

At the next crossing Bad Boy Mischief merely tugged at Blacky-ears'
sleeve, and Blacky turned slyly down the side street and was hidden in
the crowd.

Mother Grunty realized with a start that she and Little-wee Pig were
alone. "Blacky-ears!" she called piteously. "Oh-h-h, what shall I
do!" But if Blacky-ears heard, he pretended not to, and at last poor,
sorrowful Mother Grunty took Little-wee Pig by the hand and started for
the station.

Blacky-ears did not care--not he! He was so foolish that he was glad!
"Guess I'm smart enough to go it alone," he told himself. "I hate folks
always fussing over me!"

But when darkness settled down over the city, he felt uneasy. He began
to tire of gazing at shop windows.

"Guess I'll get a drink," he thought. But where?

On and on he wandered. Although he did not notice it, the stores had
been left behind and the houses were growing fewer, and farther and
farther apart. Suddenly he stopped and looked about him. "Why, I'm out
in the country," he exclaimed. "Now I can find a well of good water.
It's rather smart of me to come out where I can find a drink!"

But finding a well seemed not so easy, after all. It was dreadfully
dark, now that the street lights were far behind. Somehow, the night
was full of noises he had never before heard. "Maybe the moon will come
up by and by," he told himself. "It wouldn't be so bad if I had a drink
and--"

A long drawn-out howl made him tremble with fright! He knew that sound,
though never before had he heard it. Had not Mother Grunty told him
often just what noise the Wandering Wolf made when he came to eat up
her two fat brothers!

Blacky-ears never looked to left or to right. He did not dare. He
simply broke into a run! He had no time to remember how tired and
thirsty and hungry he was. He remembered only one thing--that a
dreadful wolf had howled!

Down went his poor little face kersplash! in the mud. He could not
breathe through his poor bruised, muddy nose. But up he jumped and on
he ran. Great muddy tears rolled off his face onto the ground, but
never once did he dare to think of stopping. Something hurt inside.
Every few steps he stumbled. Then he fell and could not move or cry out.

He remembered not at all that someone picked him up and dragged him
into shelter. He lay very still for a long time. Finally, he slowly
opened his eyes, and there stood the one person in the whole world he
wanted to see--his mother.

Yes, he had run for miles and had fallen exhausted near his own front
gate and right at the feet of Mother Grunty, who was watching anxiously
for any sign of her lost boy.

Never had the little brick house seemed so safe and cozy. "I'll be
good, Mother," he promised in a very weak voice. "I'll--I'll never-r-r
disobey again!" he sobbed.

And poor, patient Mother Grunty believed him and gathered him into her
strong mother arms where he went quietly off to sleep.

MOTHER PORKY GOES VISITING


Monday morning! And such a busy Monday morning in the little brick
house! Mother Grunty was washing clothes. The house was a bit
neglected, or so Mother Grunty thought, though a stranger entering it
would never have guessed it to be so.

The kitchen was steaming with hot suds as Mother Grunty hurried to rub
the clothes and feed her wringer so that Blacky-ears could turn it
before starting for school. And there at the table sat Little-wee, book
in hand, reading, "The clock strikes 11. How many hours ago did it
strike 2?" At eight-thirty off hurried Blacky-ears and Little-wee.

"Good-by now, dearies. Do be careful of the crossings! Little-wee, your
shoelace is dragging. There! that's better! You don't want to be called
Johnny shoestrings, do you?" And then, though she was so very busy,
Mother Grunty stood at the door smiling happily as her two trim little
piglets trotted off to school.

"Well," she said to herself as she turned back toward the kitchen, "now
I simply must go to work if I am ever to finish before night." Then
back to her washtub she whisked.

She had just caught up her clothes basket and taken steps toward the
back door when "Ringle, ringle, ring!" chimed the front doorbell. With
a sigh, Mother Grunty put down her basket, tied on a fresh gingham
apron, and went to open her door. And when she had thrown it wide, whom
should she see but her very dear friend Mother Porky, with three of her
very lovely but very lively little pigs!

"Well, well, well, this is a real surprise! Come right in," said dear,
good Mother Grunty.

"I hope it is not too much of a surprise. We know Monday is wash day,"
smiled Mother Porky.

"No, not at all,--not at all, when such good friends as you come in!"
And Mother Grunty really meant what she said, though she could not
help worrying a bit about her well-nigh empty bread box and her large
washing.

When hats and coats and rubbers had been put away and the four were
comfortably settled around the fireplace, Mother Grunty told them all
about her washing and about her untidy house and about her "picked-up"
dinner. But she told them in such a nice way, such a nice, kindly,
cordial way, that good Mother Porky had not the slightest reason to
feel unwelcome.

"I don't know when I have had breakfast dishes to wash at this hour,"
laughed Mother Grunty as she returned to the kitchen, followed by
Mother Porky and the three lovely little piglets.

"Now, my dears, you run outside and play," Mother Porky urged.
"Blacky-ears and Little-wee have a nice swing and so many playthings
out there, just you go on out now."

"All right," the two oldest agreed, but Little-tot, the baby of the
family, wanted to stay with her mother. So Mother Grunty found some
pictures and crayons and a pencil, and soon Little-tot was settled at
one end of the kitchen table, while Mother Grunty and Mother Porky
worked away at the breakfast dishes.

And such a good visit as they were having when shrieks and cries made
them hurry to the kitchen door and out onto the porch.

"Where are they!" exclaimed Mother Porky, but even as she asked, one
of her piglets came running toward her.

"Mamma! Oh, Mamma! Oh, Mamma! Do you know--?" Her breath gave out
completely and she had to stop. "Oh, Mamma!" she began once more.

"Tell us what's wrong," urged Mother Grunty rather sharply.

"Oh, Mamma! Pinky is hung up! She's hung up in the oak tree!" she
finally managed to say.

"What do you mean?" the two asked in one breath, as they hurried in the
direction of the old oak. But when they came nearer the tree, they both
gasped in surprise. The question had answered itself.

"What do you mean, Pinky! What _do_ you mean! Haven't I always told
you not to climb trees! Now, how ever are you expecting to get down!"
scolded Mother Porky.

But Mother Grunty could do nothing but laugh and laugh and laugh.
"Guess you won't need to scold her. She is taking her punishment right
now," she said.

And if you could have seen Pinky, you would have laughed with Mother
Grunty and you would have agreed with her too. Swinging from an old
stub of a dead limb was Pinky Porky. Her pretty new skirt of stout tan
kindergarten cloth was holding firm in spite of the fact that the old
limb had poked a large hole through it, just above the deep hem. And
there she swung, several feet high in the air!

"Get me down! Oh, please do get me down," she begged, and the tears
dropped right into the grasses below. "I was only trying to jump to the
ground, and my skirt caught on this horrid old limb. Get me down!"

"Well, I don't see how it's to be done," sighed Mother Porky, who was
growing very much worried for fear the skirt would tear enough more to
let her piglet crash to the ground.

But practical Mother Grunty had hurried back toward the house. In
the shed she found a stepladder and a pair of grass shears. These
she tugged back to the oak from which still hung Pinky, swinging and
swaying and begging and crying.

When Pinky saw Mother Grunty coming along with the ladder and shears,
she cried harder than ever, for she knew she could not get onto the
ladder, and she didn't know what Mother Grunty meant to do with those
large sharp-looking shears.

"Just suppose you climb this ladder and do your best to reach up and
cut off the skirt while I stand below and catch her as she drops,"
puffed Mother Grunty as she came up to them.

"Your new kindergarten dress!" sighed Mother Porky as she climbed the
ladder and waited for Mother Grunty to hand her the shears. But it was
not very easy to reach so high and to cut that stout cloth with its
heavy burden dragging at it. "Clip--snip--snap--snip--clip!" went the
shears.

"Getting it?" asked Mother Grunty. "Clip--snip--snap--clip!" again went
the shears, and down plumped Pinky into her arms with such a force that
both of them fell heavily to the ground.

"Do you know, I had forgotten all about Little-tot!" spoke up Mother
Porky as she climbed down the ladder.

"Oh, she's all right. She's still coloring away, I guess," soothed
Mother Grunty as the little procession walked gravely up the path to
the shed where the ladder and shears were put away. Then into the house
filed the same silent four, Pinky in her ragged skirt bringing up the
rear.

It was very quiet indeed in Mother Grunty's kitchen. "Where is she!"
This time Mother Porky's voice was full of anxious tears. "Little-tot,
where are you?" she groaned.

"Wite here, Mudder," came a happy, chirping voice from behind the
pantry door. Then, as the door swung open, Mother Porky sank right down
onto the wash bench and covered her face with her hands!

"Stand still, Little-tot," begged good, patient Mother Grunty. "Stand
still like a good little girl until Aunty can help you."

If ever a youngster needed help Little-tot was the one. For you will
scarcely believe what I have to tell you. There stood Little-tot, her
face and hands and dress and shoes just painted with dripping molasses,
while her feet were stuck fast in the pool of molasses that was slowly
widening on Mother Grunty's pantry floor.

"What were you trying to do?" Mother Grunty asked as she put on her
oilcloth apron and armed herself with sponges and washbasin and towels.

"Nuffin--only eatin' 'lasses," came the chirping reply. "Me just loves
'lasses. Me picked it up by han'fuls! Yep! right in bofe my han's!" How
Mother Grunty did laugh, and it was only the stickiness that kept her
from hugging the cunning piglet who liked to "eat 'lasses by han'fuls"!

But Mother Porky could not laugh, even when Mother Grunty said not one
bit of harm had been done. Indeed, she spoke of going home at once.
But, of course, Mother Grunty would not let her do that.

"Very soon now we'll have a bite to eat, and Blacky-ears and Little-wee
will be coming home to amuse the children. Then you and I can have our
good visit," she coaxed. And sure enough! Just as the Porky piglets had
been excused from the table, in bounded Blacky-ears and Little-wee,
followed by Kinky-tail and Curly-tail.

"Mumsie, we fellows want to play pirate, and first may we have some
bread and molasses?" called Blacky-ears.

"Oh! don't mention molasses in this house," said Mother Porky as she
came through the doorway. When the "pirates" spied their new playmates,
they shouted for joy, "Oh, goody! Here's somebody to rob! Come on, will
you play too?"

Now "pirate" sounded rather dangerous, but it proved a real blessing to
the two mothers who wanted a quiet chat, for not until they were called
in for supper did the piglets come in with even so much as a question.

After a supper of corn muffins and strawberry preserves, fresh creamy
milk and a fruit cake, the Porky family hurried into their wraps, for
they had a rather long ride out to Swineton.

"Now don't you ever again think of Little-tot's molasses. And you come
whenever you can," were Mother Grunty's parting words.

As she returned to her kitchen and saw her half-finished washing and
her table full of dishes, she chuckled to herself, "I always thought
Bad Boy Mischief was more friendly with my two than with any other
piglets in the world. But to-day he rode on the shoulders of two very
lovely but very lively little girls."

CHRISTMAS IN PIGLAND


Snow covered the ground, and big fleecy flakes fluttered against the
window panes of the little brick house where lived Mother Grunty and
her two little pigs.

Blacky-ears, the older of Mother Grunty's children, was filling the
wood box, singing at the top of his voice--

    "Merry, merry Christmas now is here,--
    Merry, merry Christmas, oh what cheer!"

Little-wee Pig, the younger one, was helping Mother Grunty beat eggs
for frosting and had hummed "Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the
way" until his mother _did_ wish he would change the tune.

So, you can easily guess that the month was December and that the exact
time was the day before Christmas.

"Wish I'd get a bicycle," puffed Blacky-ears excitedly, as he carefully
placed the last large chunk in the wood box.

"You have done well these last six months," answered Mother Grunty with
a happy smile, "Perhaps Santa Pig will bring it."

A knock at the door! The postman handed Mother Grunty a large parcel,
very mysterious in its red seals and "not-to-be-opened-until-Christmas"
marker.

"Put it in the old green trunk in the attic, Blacky-ears," said Mother
Grunty with a broad smile. "And then hurry down, for we must get ready
to go over to the schoolhouse."

Every Christmas eve Miss Pinky Pig, all gaily dressed in frills and
ribbons, held a Christmas entertainment at the schoolhouse. For five
years she had taught the little piggies the "rule of three," and on
each of the five Christmas eves every one of those same piggies had
been too happy for words!

When Mother Grunty and her two excited piglets entered the schoolhouse,
they were received by Miss Pinky Pig, who was very glad to see them.

"That's the very grandest Christmas tree I ever saw!" breathed
Blacky-ears, as Mother Grunty smoothed a stray lock and straightened
his tie.

"Oh, Miss Pinky, do you suppose Santa will really, truly come here to
see us?" asked Little-wee Pig.

"Yes, he has promised to come," answered Miss Pinky Pig.

Then when she gave the signal, Little-spotty Pig seated herself at the
piano and half shyly waited to be joined by Kinky-tail Pig, who carried
his violin with great dignity.

As the music sounded, the audience became very quiet. At the close of
the duet Miss Pinky Pig arose. "The primary class will sing 'Welcome,
Kind Pigs, One and All'," she announced.

And how they did sing! The parents and friends smiled to see the real
joy that shone in the face of each little singer. Miss Pinky Pig
seated them quietly before she said, "Now Brown-bacon Pig will recite
'Christmas in Pigland'."

And after songs and drills and recitations, a jingle of bells brought
all the little folks to their feet.

"O-h-h!" they cried, scarce knowing how to believe their eyes. For
there, peeping around the big, sparkling Christmas tree, stood Santa
Pig!

And you should have seen his pack! It was simply spilling out candy
boxes and oranges, blocks for the boys and paper dolls for the girls!

"Well, little ones," said Santa Pig, as he shook hands with each one.
"Now I must leave you. Be good another year. You have the very best
teacher in all Pigland. Merry Christmas! And good-night to one and all!"

With that, Santa Pig, his bells jingling a merry farewell, left the
room and--I suppose--jumped into his magic sleigh and flew away over
the housetops!

Then Miss Pinky Pig came to the platform and invited them all to stay
for cakes and sweet milk. What a buzzing as all the little pigs wished
each other a Merry Christmas! And such jolly laughter pealed forth as
they showed each other the gifts Santa had brought!

"Come, Little-wee and Blacky," smiled Mother Grunty a half-hour later,
as she started for the cloak room. "If we do not get home and to bed,
Santa Pig will not have time to fill our stockings."

So cheerfully home and happily to bed went Blacky-ears and Little-wee.
And before you could wink twice, off to dreamland they slipped--a
dreamland full of sparkling evergreen trees and music and gifts.

There was only one little fellow disappointed that night. And _his_
name was Bad Boy Mischief! He had not had one minute's chance to sit on
anyone's shoulder or to whisper in anyone's ear. Somehow, he never _is_
wanted when everyone is happy and busy doing something to make others
glad.

THE PIGLETS GO PICNICKING


On the first day of July Little-wee Pig slipped quietly up behind
Mother Grunty and gave the strings of her starched gingham apron a
vigorous tug. "Know what day it is, Mumsie?" he asked as he peeked
around to see his mother's face.

"Yes--why it's--Wednesday, isn't it?" answered Mother Grunty, who was
too busy measuring baking soda for corn cakes to give much thought to
questions.

"Yes, 'course it's Wednesday. But I don't mean that. I mean it's the
first day of July."

"Yes, yes, I guess it is. And we haven't yet torn June from the
calendar," chuckled Mother Grunty as she went to the pantry to get the
sour cream jug.

"Well, but Mother! Don't you know that in three days it will be the
Fourth of July! And we haven't a single firecracker or anything!"

"Oh-h!" It seemed to Little-wee as though his mother was dreadfully
slow in replying, "Well, let's see. I suppose we had better have a
picnic."

"Oh! a picnic! Who said picnic!" interrupted Blacky-ears as he bounded
in through the open door.

"You do startle me so when you jump at me that way, Blacky-ears," said
Mother Grunty a trifle crossly.

"Never mind, Mumsie. I'm sorry--honest I am,--but where's the picnic?"

"Wait a minute, Blacky. We don't know yet. Mother was just saying we
_might_ have one on the Fourth of July," broke in Little-wee.

The arrival of the grocery cart cut short all plans, but they must have
been discussed later, for at nine o'clock on the morning of the Fourth
a well-packed lunch basket stood on Mother Grunty's kitchen table. And
upstairs, with many gigglings and much wriggling, the Grunty family put
on their picnic togs and prepared for a wonderful day.

When, at ten o'clock, the car that was to take them to the lake stopped
at their corner, the three were hailed with many welcome shouts. For
Mother Grunty and Mother Rooty, who were very good friends, had planned
a real picnic party and had promised to care for thirty excited
piglets.

Do you wonder that they laughingly told each other that they would have
no idle minutes that day?

The ride in the open car was wonderfully cool and very pretty. At the
first sight of the lake such a shout arose that the motorman turned
quickly to see what the trouble could be. But when he saw the thirty
happy, excited faces his shoulders shook with laughter as he said to
himself, "Carried folks over this hill for twenty years now and never
heard such a fuss over the sight of a little water!"

When the car was empty of the last little pig, and every basket, box
and bundle had been carefully placed on a picnic table that stood
near by, Mother Rooty took charge of all the hats while Mother Grunty
arranged for some amusement.

"Now Curly-tail and Spotty may be leaders and choose sides. When you
are all equally divided, we can play any games you like."

"I'll choose Little-wee," piped up Spotty, and before many minutes
fifteen excited little piggies faced fifteen other equally excited
little pigs.

"Now, Spotty, what does your side choose to play? How many want to play
hide and seek?"

Only two little heads nodded; so, of course, hide and seek was
forgotten.

"How about Farmer in the Dell?"

This time every head bobbed up and down vigorously, and a merry circle,
with Blacky-ears in the center,--for someone had to be the farmer, you
know--sang lustily,

    "Farmer in the dell,
    Farmer in the dell,
    Heigh oh, the derry oh,
    The farmer in the dell."

And Curly-tail's chosen ones were not far behind, for even before
the farmer could "choose his wife," a cheery, "Here we go round the
mulberry bush" vied with the farmer-song.

Now Mother Grunty and Mother Rooty were not idle. Baskets had to be
emptied of their goodies, fresh water had to be carried from the
spring, and lemons had to be squeezed. It seemed to the two mothers
that never before had such a feast been spread.

"We'll have to carry home half of these good things," exclaimed Mother
Rooty, as she stood by, looking down at the table full of dainties.

"Call them all and see what they can do," smiled Mother Grunty who,
being the mother of two husky piglets, could guess what an amount
_thirty_ hungry piggies could eat.

And what do you think! Just what do you think that table looked like
a half-hour later? If you have been to picnics perhaps you know, but
I had better tell you that except for a few crumbs and a very little
lemonade in one glass, that table was bare.

As Mother Rooty gathered up dishes and silverware she laughed to
herself. "I never would have brought half enough if I had had the
planning of the lunch," she told Mother Grunty.

"We're going in bathing now," called several little pigs, as they
came up to the tables once more. "You said we might, you know," urged
Little-wee, as he saw his mother's look of disapproval.

"Yes, I promised, and you may do so later," explained Mother Grunty.
"It is never safe to bathe for at least an hour after eating. You just
play about until it is time for your swim."

"Oh, listen! listen! listen! There's the band playing! Oh! may we go
over where the music is?" All this in such a jumble of voices!

"That is not a band. It sounds more like a merry-go-round, I should
say," answered Mother Grunty, with a twinkle in her eye.

"Oh goody, goody! Oh goody, goody!" sang Little-wee. For Little-wee
never could be very much delighted without breaking into his favorite
jingle.

So, gathering up all the baggage, off they went. And Mother Grunty was
right; the very merriest kind of merry-go-round was just ready to start
on another "trip."

I just know you can guess what happened next. Yes, they all jumped on.
And, luckily, that merry-go-round could carry just thirty piglets!
After the first ride another was demanded, and then another and still
another, though they were warned that there would be no time for the
play in the lake. But, do you know, it seemed as though that music just
bewitched them!

If long, heavy, distant rumbles of thunder had not warned these
merrymakers, no telling how long they would have kept whirling. But
with the storm sending down large, splashy raindrops the picnickers
hurried for the trolley station.

The ride home was lots of fun, for the car was closed to keep out the
rain. "Let's sing 'Merrily We Roll Along,'" someone suggested. And sing
they did! Not even could the thunder be heard!

Fathers and big brothers, carrying raincoats and umbrellas enough for
all, waited at the station as the trolley rolled into town.

"Haven't we had just the loveliest time!" exclaimed Little-wee, as the
three Gruntys turned in at the doorway of the little brick house.

"Mother," asked Blacky-ears as they waited for the door to be
unlocked--"Mother,--was Bad Boy Mischief there at the picnic?"

"I didn't see anything of him--not a glimpse all day. And that is
a pretty good record when thirty little pigs go off for an all-day
picnic!"

MISS PINKY PIG VISITS MOTHER GRUNTY


For ever and ever so long Mother Grunty had been wondering what should
be done about Blacky-ears once he had finished his schooling at the
little old stone schoolhouse. So one day in early spring she decided
to talk things over with Miss Pinky Pig, who still taught the "rule of
three" to all the lively piglets in the district.

Mother Grunty wrote a very cordial little note, asking her to come for
supper on the following Thursday. Blacky-ears and Little-wee could
scarcely wait for Thursday to come. They did love Miss Pinky Pig! Even
to be allowed to carry her books or sharpen her pencil made them very
happy. But to have her promise to walk home with them and stay to
supper was the very nicest thing that could happen!

Mother Grunty had fruit cakes tucked away and sugared doughnuts sealed
in stone jars and fresh molasses cookies in the cooky box. And when
Thursday finally came, and good Mother Grunty had finished her work and
gone upstairs to put on her most becoming dress and dainty white apron,
whiffs of apple pie and chocolate frosting and other mysterious goodies
floated everywhere.

"I don't wonder they all love her," Mother Grunty murmured as she
peeped out of the front window to see dainty Miss Pinky Pig and
Blacky-ears and Little-wee coming up the gravel path toward the little
brick house. "She is so pretty and sweet and so very, very good,"
breathed Mother Grunty thankfully as she opened the door to greet the
three.

"I have enjoyed this walk so much, Mother Grunty," smiled Miss Pinky
Pig as she seated herself before the fireplace where a cheery fire of
logs crackled merrily and quite drove away the sharpness of the early
spring air. "What a wonderful fireplace! You must enjoy it so much.
Have you lived in this house always, Mother Grunty?"

"Oh yes, ever since I can remember,--or almost as long. It was to this
house I came at the dreadful time when my two brothers were eaten by
the Wandering Wolf," Mother Grunty answered with a far-away light in
her eyes.

"Why, Mother Grunty, I never knew _you_ were the heroine of that
oft-repeated tale of years ago. I do wish you would tell me the real
story just word for word as it happened."

"Well, of course you know my two brothers and I were alone. Finally we
decided to go out into the world and each follow his own wishes.

"Everyone wonders how it happened that one of the three built a house
of straw and one a house of wood, while I had this strong house of
bricks. Now very few know the real reason which is this:--

"From the time we were tiny, wee pigs our mother had given each of us
an equal amount of money each week. Well, my brothers used to make
fun of me because I never spent my share. They called me stingy and
were sometimes very unkind. But when the day came for us to seek our
fortunes, I had more money than the other two together.

"My older brother had only enough left to buy straw for a house, but he
meant to work hard and save and buy a better and stronger home as soon
as ever he could. My other brother could almost pay for a wooden house,
and finding an old friend who would trust him, he settled himself very
comfortably, we all thought. But I, with all my saved-up pennies,
settled on this land and built this same strong little brick house.

"We were scarcely settled when, without any warning, along came the
Wandering Wolf and killed my older brother, and ate him up.

"Now, most unfortunately, my younger brother was at town, making
arrangements for a good housekeeper when this happened, or he would
have been warned at least. But, do you know, he had scarcely gone into
his house and closed the door when the dreadful huffing and puffing
started just outside his house! I heard some noise over that way, but
before I could find out what had caused it, the wolf had finished his
dreadful work and was coming this way.

"My doors and windows were barred because, living here alone in those
days one had to be very, very careful, so I just kept as still as I
could.

"I shook with fear and could scarcely keep from crying out when he
started jumping at the door and huffing and puffing!

"Of course, he could not get in. So he changed his plans. Why, Miss
Pinky Pig, I can see his wicked grin to this day! He tried time and
time again to catch me. And once when I was up in an apple tree I
nearly fell with fright when I saw him below, glaring up at me. But I
escaped, as you see," Mother Grunty smiled.

"Didn't you once roll down the hill in a churn?" asked Miss Pinky Pig.

"You bet she did," answered Blacky-ears, who never could hear the tale
often enough.

"Well, finally,--and if you'll excuse me, I'll take you out to the
kitchen and prepare a bit of supper while I finish my tale--finally,
one day the wicked Wandering Wolf grew beside himself with rage and
scrambled up onto this roof. The old roof was of shingles, and it makes
me shiver even yet to remember how his heavy feet scratched and clawed
on the thin wood!

"Well, I was ready for him. I hung this same old iron kettle over my
roaring fireplace and--well, do you know, I can never bear to tell
anybody what happened next. But until this day I have never seen
another wolf," she ended as they seated themselves at the dainty table.

"I heard a wolf once," ventured Blacky-ears.

"Tell her about the time Blacky-ears was lost, Mumsie," urged
Little-wee Pig.

And so on and on they talked until Miss Pinky Pig simply had to leave
for home.

"And here I intended to talk school all the time," said Mother Grunty
as she helped Miss Pinky Pig into her coat. "Won't you come back again
next Thursday?" And Miss Pinky Pig said she certainly would.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
