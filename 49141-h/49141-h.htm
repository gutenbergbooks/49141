<h2><a name="A_TRIP_TO_STYFORD" id="A_TRIP_TO_STYFORD">A TRIP TO STYFORD</a></h2>


<p>You have all heard of the three little pigs.
And you know all about how Old Mother Pig
sent them forth to seek their fortunes, don't
you? Of course you do!</p>

<p>You remember, too, how the Wandering Wolf
frightened the one in the straw house and "ate
up that poor little pig." And you will never forget
how he afterwards scared the one in the
wooden house and "ate up <i>that</i> poor little pig."
And then, were you ever so glad, in all your life,
as when he tried and tried and simply could not
get the third little pig&mdash;that cunning, curly-tailed,
squeaky-voiced little pig who lived in the
little brick house!</p>

<p>Well, of course, this last little pig, whose name
was Grunty, lived safely in her neat little red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
brick house for many years after the day when
she ate up the Wandering Wolf for her dinner.</p>

<p>Some years after that day of feasting, Grunty
Pig had two wee piggies of her own. The older
one was white all over, except for his two black
ears, so Mother Grunty at once named him
Blacky-ears. The younger one looked just as his
mother had looked when she was little&mdash;white
all over, with a curly tail and a squeaky voice so
cheery that everyone smiled when he spoke. He
was called Little-wee Pig.</p>

<p>One day in June Mother Grunty thought she
must go on a journey, and she worried about
leaving Blacky-ears and Little-wee Pig alone,
for she had not forgotten that the Wandering
Wolves were not all dead and that one of them
might get after her babies.</p>

<p>"Come here, piglets," she called from her
kitchen window.</p>

<p>"All right, Mother, I'm coming," answered
Little-wee Pig as he jumped from his swing and
ran to the house.</p>

<p>But not so Blacky-ears! And I'll tell you why.
Bad Boy Mischief, you remember, is always
after everyone; little children, little bears, and
little pigs. Blacky-ears, I am sorry to say, had
been very friendly with him. So, as soon as Bad
Boy Mischief heard Mother Grunty call, he
hopped right onto Blacky's shoulder and whispered
in his ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>And what do you suppose? Blacky-ears listened
and answered his mother just as Bad Boy
Mischief had told him to! "Aw, wait a minute,
can't you?" he grumbled!</p>

<p>When Mother Grunty called the second time,
Blacky-ears managed to jerk himself into the
house and stand sulkily beside her chair. Then
she told the two piggies of her plan.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mother Grunty, "I find that I
must go to Styford at once. I fear to leave you
here alone, for I too well remember what happened
to my two brothers. So, if you'll promise
to be very, very good, you may go with me."</p>

<p>"Oh goody, goody!" sang Little-wee Pig, dancing
around his mother's chair.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for some fun!" cried Blacky-ears.</p>

<p>"You will promise to be good, my dears?" said
Mother Grunty anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Mother, we'll be good," answered
Little-wee Pig.</p>

<p>"You bet!" cried Blacky-ears.</p>

<p>So everything was hustle and bustle in the
little brick house, for Mother Grunty was very
neat. And everything must be made tidy and
not one speck of dust must be left behind. But
finally, on the third day, came the time to go.</p>

<p>Blacky-ears, dressed in his new blue suit with
its shiny brass buttons, and wearing his little
round cap set straight between his ears, looked
as neat as a new pin. And Little-wee Pig, all in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
white except for his bright red sailor tie, was attractive
too. But you should have seen the
charming Mother Grunty in her trim black suit
and sailor hat to match! Then you would have
said, "Isn't she splendid!"</p>

<p>On the train everyone was happy, for even in
that short ride there were many interesting
sights. And Mother Grunty was ever so patient
about explaining.</p>

<p>"Let's play 'I Spy,'" cried Blacky-ears.</p>

<p>"I mean, tell what we can spy out of the
window. Whoever sees a thing first can say 'I
spy.' Watch sharply! Oh, I spy a tall pine tree
on a hill."</p>

<p>"I spy a tiny brook," called Little-wee Pig.</p>

<p>"Styford! Styford!" called the brakeman.
And what a hustle to slip into wraps and gather
up bundles!</p>

<p>Styford was a busy city, and Mother Grunty
was very nervous. Such a hurrying and so much
noise! It seemed to the three country pigs that
they could never cross the main street!</p>

<p>"Take my hands, my dears," Mother Grunty
urged anxiously. At the first crossing they did
so. But soon Blacky-ears became used to the
noise and hurry. Before he knew it, Bad Boy
Mischief was once more riding on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You're too old to take anyone's hand. You're
smart enough to take care of yourself," he
whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>And Blacky-ears listened. He jerked his hand
out of his mother's and ran across the street.
A large red hose wagon clanged out of the side
street and just missed knocking him flat!</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" shrieked Mother Grunty as she hurried
to catch him. "Why will you do such
things? You promised me you would be so good.
I fear you'll come to some bad end."</p>

<p>But that was only the beginning of the
trouble. In the "Piggie and Wiggie" shop
Blacky-ears bumped rudely against a case of
glass dishes, jarring two of them to the floor,
where they broke to slivers.</p>

<p>While his poor mother was helping the clerk
clean up the scattered glass, Blacky-ears pried
open her purse and sent the change jingling to
the floor. Poor Mother Grunty! She was almost
ready to give up!</p>

<p>At the next crossing Bad Boy Mischief merely
tugged at Blacky-ears' sleeve, and Blacky
turned slyly down the side street and was hidden
in the crowd.</p>

<p>Mother Grunty realized with a start that she
and Little-wee Pig were alone. "Blacky-ears!"
she called piteously. "Oh-h-h, what shall I do!"
But if Blacky-ears heard, he pretended not to,
and at last poor, sorrowful Mother Grunty took
Little-wee Pig by the hand and started for the
station.</p>

<p>Blacky-ears did not care&mdash;not he! He was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
foolish that he was glad! "Guess I'm smart
enough to go it alone," he told himself. "I hate
folks always fussing over me!"</p>

<p>But when darkness settled down over the city,
he felt uneasy. He began to tire of gazing at
shop windows.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll get a drink," he thought. But
where?</p>

<p>On and on he wandered. Although he did not
notice it, the stores had been left behind and the
houses were growing fewer, and farther and
farther apart. Suddenly he stopped and looked
about him. "Why, I'm out in the country," he
exclaimed. "Now I can find a well of good water.
It's rather smart of me to come out where
I can find a drink!"</p>

<p>But finding a well seemed not so easy, after all.
It was dreadfully dark, now that the street
lights were far behind. Somehow, the night was
full of noises he had never before heard. "Maybe
the moon will come up by and by," he told
himself. "It wouldn't be so bad if I had a drink
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A long drawn-out howl made him tremble
with fright! He knew that sound, though never
before had he heard it. Had not Mother
Grunty told him often just what noise the Wandering
Wolf made when he came to eat up her
two fat brothers!</p>

<p>Blacky-ears never looked to left or to right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
He did not dare. He simply broke into a run!
He had no time to remember how tired and
thirsty and hungry he was. He remembered
only one thing&mdash;that a dreadful wolf had
howled!</p>

<p>Down went his poor little face kersplash! in
the mud. He could not breathe through his poor
bruised, muddy nose. But up he jumped and on
he ran. Great muddy tears rolled off his face
onto the ground, but never once did he dare to
think of stopping. Something hurt inside.
Every few steps he stumbled. Then he fell and
could not move or cry out.</p>

<p>He remembered not at all that someone picked
him up and dragged him into shelter. He lay
very still for a long time. Finally, he slowly
opened his eyes, and there stood the one person
in the whole world he wanted to see&mdash;his mother.</p>

<p>Yes, he had run for miles and had fallen exhausted
near his own front gate and right at the
feet of Mother Grunty, who was watching
anxiously for any sign of her lost boy.</p>

<p>Never had the little brick house seemed so safe
and cozy. "I'll be good, Mother," he promised in
a very weak voice. "I'll&mdash;I'll never-r-r disobey
again!" he sobbed.</p>

<p>And poor, patient Mother Grunty believed him
and gathered him into her strong mother arms
where he went quietly off to sleep.</p>

<h2><a name="MOTHER_PORKY_GOES_VISITING" id="MOTHER_PORKY_GOES_VISITING">MOTHER PORKY GOES VISITING</a></h2>


<p>Monday morning! And such a busy Monday
morning in the little brick house! Mother
Grunty was washing clothes. The house was a
bit neglected, or so Mother Grunty thought,
though a stranger entering it would never have
guessed it to be so.</p>

<p>The kitchen was steaming with hot suds as
Mother Grunty hurried to rub the clothes and
feed her wringer so that Blacky-ears could turn
it before starting for school. And there at the
table sat Little-wee, book in hand, reading, "The
clock strikes 11. How many hours ago did it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
strike 2?" At eight-thirty off hurried Blacky-ears
and Little-wee.</p>

<p>"Good-by now, dearies. Do be careful of the
crossings! Little-wee, your shoelace is dragging.
There! that's better! You don't want to
be called Johnny shoestrings, do you?" And
then, though she was so very busy, Mother
Grunty stood at the door smiling happily as her
two trim little piglets trotted off to school.</p>

<p>"Well," she said to herself as she turned back
toward the kitchen, "now I simply must go to
work if I am ever to finish before night." Then
back to her washtub she whisked.</p>

<p>She had just caught up her clothes basket and
taken steps toward the back door when "Ringle,
ringle, ring!" chimed the front doorbell. With
a sigh, Mother Grunty put down her basket, tied
on a fresh gingham apron, and went to open
her door. And when she had thrown it wide,
whom should she see but her very dear friend
Mother Porky, with three of her very lovely but
very lively little pigs!</p>

<p>"Well, well, well, this is a real surprise! Come
right in," said dear, good Mother Grunty.</p>

<p>"I hope it is not too much of a surprise. We
know Monday is wash day," smiled Mother
Porky.</p>

<p>"No, not at all,&mdash;not at all, when such good
friends as you come in!" And Mother Grunty
really meant what she said, though she could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
help worrying a bit about her well-nigh empty
bread box and her large washing.</p>

<p>When hats and coats and rubbers had been put
away and the four were comfortably settled
around the fireplace, Mother Grunty told them
all about her washing and about her untidy
house and about her "picked-up" dinner. But
she told them in such a nice way, such a nice,
kindly, cordial way, that good Mother Porky
had not the slightest reason to feel unwelcome.</p>

<p>"I don't know when I have had breakfast
dishes to wash at this hour," laughed Mother
Grunty as she returned to the kitchen, followed
by Mother Porky and the three lovely little piglets.</p>

<p>"Now, my dears, you run outside and play,"
Mother Porky urged. "Blacky-ears and Little-wee
have a nice swing and so many playthings
out there, just you go on out now."</p>

<p>"All right," the two oldest agreed, but Little-tot,
the baby of the family, wanted to stay with
her mother. So Mother Grunty found some pictures
and crayons and a pencil, and soon Little-tot
was settled at one end of the kitchen table,
while Mother Grunty and Mother Porky worked
away at the breakfast dishes.</p>

<p>And such a good visit as they were having
when shrieks and cries made them hurry to the
kitchen door and out onto the porch.</p>

<p>"Where are they!" exclaimed Mother Porky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
but even as she asked, one of her piglets came
running toward her.</p>

<p>"Mamma! Oh, Mamma! Oh, Mamma! Do
you know&mdash;?" Her breath gave out completely
and she had to stop. "Oh, Mamma!" she began
once more.</p>

<p>"Tell us what's wrong," urged Mother Grunty
rather sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mamma! Pinky is hung up! She's hung
up in the oak tree!" she finally managed to say.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" the two asked in one
breath, as they hurried in the direction of the
old oak. But when they came nearer the tree,
they both gasped in surprise. The question had
answered itself.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Pinky! What <i>do</i> you
mean! Haven't I always told you not to climb
trees! Now, how ever are you expecting to get
down!" scolded Mother Porky.</p>

<p>But Mother Grunty could do nothing but
laugh and laugh and laugh. "Guess you won't
need to scold her. She is taking her punishment
right now," she said.</p>

<p>And if you could have seen Pinky, you would
have laughed with Mother Grunty and you
would have agreed with her too. Swinging from
an old stub of a dead limb was Pinky Porky.
Her pretty new skirt of stout tan kindergarten
cloth was holding firm in spite of the fact that
the old limb had poked a large hole through it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
just above the deep hem. And there she swung,
several feet high in the air!</p>

<p>"Get me down! Oh, please do get me down,"
she begged, and the tears dropped right into the
grasses below. "I was only trying to jump to
the ground, and my skirt caught on this horrid
old limb. Get me down!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see how it's to be done," sighed
Mother Porky, who was growing very much
worried for fear the skirt would tear enough
more to let her piglet crash to the ground.</p>

<p>But practical Mother Grunty had hurried
back toward the house. In the shed she found a
stepladder and a pair of grass shears. These she
tugged back to the oak from which still hung
Pinky, swinging and swaying and begging and
crying.</p>

<p>When Pinky saw Mother Grunty coming
along with the ladder and shears, she cried
harder than ever, for she knew she could not get
onto the ladder, and she didn't know what
Mother Grunty meant to do with those large
sharp-looking shears.</p>

<p>"Just suppose you climb this ladder and do
your best to reach up and cut off the skirt while
I stand below and catch her as she drops," puffed
Mother Grunty as she came up to them.</p>

<p>"Your new kindergarten dress!" sighed Mother
Porky as she climbed the ladder and waited
for Mother Grunty to hand her the shears. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
it was not very easy to reach so high and to cut
that stout cloth with its heavy burden dragging
at it. "Clip&mdash;snip&mdash;snap&mdash;snip&mdash;clip!" went the
shears.</p>

<p>"Getting it?" asked Mother Grunty. "Clip&mdash;snip&mdash;snap&mdash;clip!"
again went the shears, and
down plumped Pinky into her arms with such a
force that both of them fell heavily to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Do you know, I had forgotten all about
Little-tot!" spoke up Mother Porky as she
climbed down the ladder.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's all right. She's still coloring away,
I guess," soothed Mother Grunty as the little
procession walked gravely up the path to the
shed where the ladder and shears were put
away. Then into the house filed the same silent
four, Pinky in her ragged skirt bringing up
the rear.</p>

<p>It was very quiet indeed in Mother Grunty's
kitchen. "Where is she!" This time Mother
Porky's voice was full of anxious tears. "Little-tot,
where are you?" she groaned.</p>

<p>"Wite here, Mudder," came a happy, chirping
voice from behind the pantry door. Then, as the
door swung open, Mother Porky sank right
down onto the wash bench and covered her face
with her hands!</p>

<p>"Stand still, Little-tot," begged good, patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Mother Grunty. "Stand still like a good little
girl until Aunty can help you."</p>

<p>If ever a youngster needed help Little-tot was
the one. For you will scarcely believe what I
have to tell you. There stood Little-tot, her face
and hands and dress and shoes just painted with
dripping molasses, while her feet were stuck fast
in the pool of molasses that was slowly widening
on Mother Grunty's pantry floor.</p>

<p>"What were you trying to do?" Mother
Grunty asked as she put on her oilcloth apron
and armed herself with sponges and washbasin
and towels.</p>

<p>"Nuffin&mdash;only eatin' 'lasses," came the chirping
reply. "Me just loves 'lasses. Me picked it
up by han'fuls! Yep! right in bofe my han's!"
How Mother Grunty did laugh, and it was only
the stickiness that kept her from hugging the
cunning piglet who liked to "eat 'lasses by han'fuls"!</p>

<p>But Mother Porky could not laugh, even when
Mother Grunty said not one bit of harm had
been done. Indeed, she spoke of going home at
once. But, of course, Mother Grunty would not
let her do that.</p>

<p>"Very soon now we'll have a bite to eat, and
Blacky-ears and Little-wee will be coming home
to amuse the children. Then you and I can have
our good visit," she coaxed. And sure enough!
Just as the Porky piglets had been excused from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the table, in bounded Blacky-ears and Little-wee,
followed by Kinky-tail and Curly-tail.</p>

<p>"Mumsie, we fellows want to play pirate, and
first may we have some bread and molasses?"
called Blacky-ears.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't mention molasses in this house,"
said Mother Porky as she came through the
doorway. When the "pirates" spied their new
playmates, they shouted for joy, "Oh, goody!
Here's somebody to rob! Come on, will you play
too?"</p>

<p>Now "pirate" sounded rather dangerous, but
it proved a real blessing to the two mothers who
wanted a quiet chat, for not until they were
called in for supper did the piglets come in with
even so much as a question.</p>

<p>After a supper of corn muffins and strawberry
preserves, fresh creamy milk and a fruit cake,
the Porky family hurried into their wraps, for
they had a rather long ride out to Swineton.</p>

<p>"Now don't you ever again think of Little-tot's
molasses. And you come whenever you can,"
were Mother Grunty's parting words.</p>

<p>As she returned to her kitchen and saw her
half-finished washing and her table full of
dishes, she chuckled to herself, "I always
thought Bad Boy Mischief was more friendly
with my two than with any other piglets in the
world. But to-day he rode on the shoulders of
two very lovely but very lively little girls."</p>

<h2><a name="CHRISTMAS_IN_PIGLAND" id="CHRISTMAS_IN_PIGLAND">CHRISTMAS IN PIGLAND</a></h2>


<p>Snow covered the ground, and big fleecy flakes
fluttered against the window panes of the little
brick house where lived Mother Grunty and her
two little pigs.</p>

<p>Blacky-ears, the older of Mother Grunty's
children, was filling the wood box, singing at the
top of his voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Merry, merry Christmas now is here,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Merry, merry Christmas, oh what cheer!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Little-wee Pig, the younger one, was helping
Mother Grunty beat eggs for frosting and had
hummed "Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the
way" until his mother <i>did</i> wish he would change
the tune.</p>

<p>So, you can easily guess that the month was
December and that the exact time was the day
before Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wish I'd get a bicycle," puffed Blacky-ears
excitedly, as he carefully placed the last large
chunk in the wood box.</p>

<p>"You have done well these last six months,"
answered Mother Grunty with a happy smile,
"Perhaps Santa Pig will bring it."</p>

<p>A knock at the door! The postman handed
Mother Grunty a large parcel, very mysterious
in its red seals and "not-to-be-opened-until-Christmas"
marker.</p>

<p>"Put it in the old green trunk in the attic,
Blacky-ears," said Mother Grunty with a broad
smile. "And then hurry down, for we must get
ready to go over to the schoolhouse."</p>

<p>Every Christmas eve Miss Pinky Pig, all gaily
dressed in frills and ribbons, held a Christmas
entertainment at the schoolhouse. For five
years she had taught the little piggies the "rule
of three," and on each of the five Christmas eves
every one of those same piggies had been too
happy for words!</p>

<p>When Mother Grunty and her two excited piglets
entered the schoolhouse, they were received
by Miss Pinky Pig, who was very glad to see
them.</p>

<p>"That's the very grandest Christmas tree I
ever saw!" breathed Blacky-ears, as Mother
Grunty smoothed a stray lock and straightened
his tie.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Pinky, do you suppose Santa will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
really, truly come here to see us?" asked Little-wee
Pig.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has promised to come," answered
Miss Pinky Pig.</p>

<p>Then when she gave the signal, Little-spotty
Pig seated herself at the piano and half shyly
waited to be joined by Kinky-tail Pig, who carried
his violin with great dignity.</p>

<p>As the music sounded, the audience became
very quiet. At the close of the duet Miss Pinky
Pig arose. "The primary class will sing 'Welcome,
Kind Pigs, One and All'," she announced.</p>

<p>And how they did sing! The parents and
friends smiled to see the real joy that shone in
the face of each little singer. Miss Pinky Pig
seated them quietly before she said, "Now
Brown-bacon Pig will recite 'Christmas in Pigland'."</p>

<p>And after songs and drills and recitations, a
jingle of bells brought all the little folks to their
feet.</p>

<p>"O-h-h!" they cried, scarce knowing how to
believe their eyes. For there, peeping around
the big, sparkling Christmas tree, stood Santa
Pig!</p>

<p>And you should have seen his pack! It was
simply spilling out candy boxes and oranges,
blocks for the boys and paper dolls for the girls!</p>

<p>"Well, little ones," said Santa Pig, as he shook
hands with each one. "Now I must leave you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Be good another year. You have the very best
teacher in all Pigland. Merry Christmas! And
good-night to one and all!"</p>

<p>With that, Santa Pig, his bells jingling a
merry farewell, left the room and&mdash;I suppose&mdash;jumped
into his magic sleigh and flew away over
the housetops!</p>

<p>Then Miss Pinky Pig came to the platform and
invited them all to stay for cakes and sweet
milk. What a buzzing as all the little pigs
wished each other a Merry Christmas! And
such jolly laughter pealed forth as they showed
each other the gifts Santa had brought!</p>

<p>"Come, Little-wee and Blacky," smiled Mother
Grunty a half-hour later, as she started for the
cloak room. "If we do not get home and to bed,
Santa Pig will not have time to fill our stockings."</p>

<p>So cheerfully home and happily to bed went
Blacky-ears and Little-wee. And before you
could wink twice, off to dreamland they slipped&mdash;a
dreamland full of sparkling evergreen trees
and music and gifts.</p>

<p>There was only one little fellow disappointed
that night. And <i>his</i> name was Bad Boy Mischief!
He had not had one minute's chance to
sit on anyone's shoulder or to whisper in anyone's
ear. Somehow, he never <i>is</i> wanted when
everyone is happy and busy doing something to
make others glad.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PIGLETS_GO_PICNICKING" id="THE_PIGLETS_GO_PICNICKING">THE PIGLETS GO PICNICKING</a></h2>


<p>On the first day of July Little-wee Pig slipped
quietly up behind Mother Grunty and gave the
strings of her starched gingham apron a vigorous
tug. "Know what day it is, Mumsie?" he
asked as he peeked around to see his mother's
face.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;why it's&mdash;Wednesday, isn't it?" answered
Mother Grunty, who was too busy
measuring baking soda for corn cakes to give
much thought to questions.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'course it's Wednesday. But I don't
mean that. I mean it's the first day of July."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I guess it is. And we haven't yet
torn June from the calendar," chuckled Mother
Grunty as she went to the pantry to get the sour
cream jug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, but Mother! Don't you know that in
three days it will be the Fourth of July! And
we haven't a single firecracker or anything!"</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" It seemed to Little-wee as though his
mother was dreadfully slow in replying, "Well,
let's see. I suppose we had better have a picnic."</p>

<p>"Oh! a picnic! Who said picnic!" interrupted
Blacky-ears as he bounded in through the open
door.</p>

<p>"You do startle me so when you jump at me
that way, Blacky-ears," said Mother Grunty a
trifle crossly.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Mumsie. I'm sorry&mdash;honest I
am,&mdash;but where's the picnic?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Blacky. We don't know yet.
Mother was just saying we <i>might</i> have one on
the Fourth of July," broke in Little-wee.</p>

<p>The arrival of the grocery cart cut short all
plans, but they must have been discussed later,
for at nine o'clock on the morning of the Fourth
a well-packed lunch basket stood on Mother
Grunty's kitchen table. And upstairs, with
many gigglings and much wriggling, the Grunty
family put on their picnic togs and prepared for
a wonderful day.</p>

<p>When, at ten o'clock, the car that was to take
them to the lake stopped at their corner, the
three were hailed with many welcome shouts.
For Mother Grunty and Mother Rooty, who
were very good friends, had planned a real picnic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
party and had promised to care for thirty
excited piglets.</p>

<p>Do you wonder that they laughingly told each
other that they would have no idle minutes that
day?</p>

<p>The ride in the open car was wonderfully cool
and very pretty. At the first sight of the lake
such a shout arose that the motorman turned
quickly to see what the trouble could be. But
when he saw the thirty happy, excited faces his
shoulders shook with laughter as he said to himself,
"Carried folks over this hill for twenty
years now and never heard such a fuss over the
sight of a little water!"</p>

<p>When the car was empty of the last little pig,
and every basket, box and bundle had been carefully
placed on a picnic table that stood near by,
Mother Rooty took charge of all the hats while
Mother Grunty arranged for some amusement.</p>

<p>"Now Curly-tail and Spotty may be leaders
and choose sides. When you are all equally divided,
we can play any games you like."</p>

<p>"I'll choose Little-wee," piped up Spotty, and
before many minutes fifteen excited little piggies
faced fifteen other equally excited little
pigs.</p>

<p>"Now, Spotty, what does your side choose to
play? How many want to play hide and seek?"</p>

<p>Only two little heads nodded; so, of course,
hide and seek was forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"How about Farmer in the Dell?"</p>

<p>This time every head bobbed up and down
vigorously, and a merry circle, with Blacky-ears
in the center,&mdash;for someone had to be the farmer,
you know&mdash;sang lustily,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Farmer in the dell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farmer in the dell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heigh oh, the derry oh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The farmer in the dell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Curly-tail's chosen ones were not far behind,
for even before the farmer could "choose
his wife," a cheery, "Here we go round the mulberry
bush" vied with the farmer-song.</p>

<p>Now Mother Grunty and Mother Rooty were
not idle. Baskets had to be emptied of their
goodies, fresh water had to be carried from the
spring, and lemons had to be squeezed. It
seemed to the two mothers that never before had
such a feast been spread.</p>

<p>"We'll have to carry home half of these good
things," exclaimed Mother Rooty, as she stood
by, looking down at the table full of dainties.</p>

<p>"Call them all and see what they can do,"
smiled Mother Grunty who, being the mother of
two husky piglets, could guess what an amount
<i>thirty</i> hungry piggies could eat.</p>

<p>And what do you think! Just what do you
think that table looked like a half-hour later?
If you have been to picnics perhaps you know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
but I had better tell you that except for a few
crumbs and a very little lemonade in one glass,
that table was bare.</p>

<p>As Mother Rooty gathered up dishes and silverware
she laughed to herself. "I never would
have brought half enough if I had had the planning
of the lunch," she told Mother Grunty.</p>

<p>"We're going in bathing now," called several
little pigs, as they came up to the tables once
more. "You said we might, you know," urged
Little-wee, as he saw his mother's look of disapproval.</p>

<p>"Yes, I promised, and you may do so later,"
explained Mother Grunty. "It is never safe to
bathe for at least an hour after eating. You
just play about until it is time for your swim."</p>

<p>"Oh, listen! listen! listen! There's the band
playing! Oh! may we go over where the music
is?" All this in such a jumble of voices!</p>

<p>"That is not a band. It sounds more like a
merry-go-round, I should say," answered Mother
Grunty, with a twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>"Oh goody, goody! Oh goody, goody!" sang
Little-wee. For Little-wee never could be very
much delighted without breaking into his favorite
jingle.</p>

<p>So, gathering up all the baggage, off they
went. And Mother Grunty was right; the very
merriest kind of merry-go-round was just ready
to start on another "trip."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>I just know you can guess what happened
next. Yes, they all jumped on. And, luckily, that
merry-go-round could carry just thirty piglets!
After the first ride another was demanded, and
then another and still another, though they were
warned that there would be no time for the
play in the lake. But, do you know, it seemed
as though that music just bewitched them!</p>

<p>If long, heavy, distant rumbles of thunder had
not warned these merrymakers, no telling how
long they would have kept whirling. But with
the storm sending down large, splashy raindrops
the picnickers hurried for the trolley station.</p>

<p>The ride home was lots of fun, for the car
was closed to keep out the rain. "Let's sing
'Merrily We Roll Along,'" someone suggested.
And sing they did! Not even could the thunder
be heard!</p>

<p>Fathers and big brothers, carrying raincoats
and umbrellas enough for all, waited at the station
as the trolley rolled into town.</p>

<p>"Haven't we had just the loveliest time!" exclaimed
Little-wee, as the three Gruntys turned
in at the doorway of the little brick house.</p>

<p>"Mother," asked Blacky-ears as they waited
for the door to be unlocked&mdash;"Mother,&mdash;was
Bad Boy Mischief there at the picnic?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see anything of him&mdash;not a glimpse
all day. And that is a pretty good record when
thirty little pigs go off for an all-day picnic!"</p>

<h2><a name="MISS_PINKY_PIG_VISITS_MOTHER_GRUNTY" id="MISS_PINKY_PIG_VISITS_MOTHER_GRUNTY">MISS PINKY PIG VISITS MOTHER GRUNTY</a></h2>


<p>For ever and ever so long Mother Grunty had
been wondering what should be done about
Blacky-ears once he had finished his schooling at
the little old stone schoolhouse. So one day in
early spring she decided to talk things over with
Miss Pinky Pig, who still taught the "rule of
three" to all the lively piglets in the district.</p>

<p>Mother Grunty wrote a very cordial little note,
asking her to come for supper on the following
Thursday. Blacky-ears and Little-wee could
scarcely wait for Thursday to come. They did
love Miss Pinky Pig! Even to be allowed to
carry her books or sharpen her pencil made
them very happy. But to have her promise to
walk home with them and stay to supper was
the very nicest thing that could happen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother Grunty had fruit cakes tucked away
and sugared doughnuts sealed in stone jars and
fresh molasses cookies in the cooky box. And
when Thursday finally came, and good Mother
Grunty had finished her work and gone upstairs
to put on her most becoming dress and dainty
white apron, whiffs of apple pie and chocolate
frosting and other mysterious goodies floated
everywhere.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder they all love her," Mother
Grunty murmured as she peeped out of the front
window to see dainty Miss Pinky Pig and
Blacky-ears and Little-wee coming up the gravel
path toward the little brick house. "She is so
pretty and sweet and so very, very good,"
breathed Mother Grunty thankfully as she
opened the door to greet the three.</p>

<p>"I have enjoyed this walk so much, Mother
Grunty," smiled Miss Pinky Pig as she seated
herself before the fireplace where a cheery fire
of logs crackled merrily and quite drove away
the sharpness of the early spring air. "What a
wonderful fireplace! You must enjoy it so
much. Have you lived in this house always,
Mother Grunty?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, ever since I can remember,&mdash;or almost
as long. It was to this house I came at the
dreadful time when my two brothers were eaten
by the Wandering Wolf," Mother Grunty answered
with a far-away light in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Mother Grunty, I never knew <i>you</i> were
the heroine of that oft-repeated tale of years
ago. I do wish you would tell me the real story
just word for word as it happened."</p>

<p>"Well, of course you know my two brothers
and I were alone. Finally we decided to go out
into the world and each follow his own wishes.</p>

<p>"Everyone wonders how it happened that one
of the three built a house of straw and one a
house of wood, while I had this strong house of
bricks. Now very few know the real reason
which is this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From the time we were tiny, wee pigs our
mother had given each of us an equal amount
of money each week. Well, my brothers used to
make fun of me because I never spent my share.
They called me stingy and were sometimes very
unkind. But when the day came for us to seek
our fortunes, I had more money than the other
two together.</p>

<p>"My older brother had only enough left to buy
straw for a house, but he meant to work hard
and save and buy a better and stronger home as
soon as ever he could. My other brother could
almost pay for a wooden house, and finding an
old friend who would trust him, he settled himself
very comfortably, we all thought. But I,
with all my saved-up pennies, settled on this land
and built this same strong little brick house.</p>

<p>"We were scarcely settled when, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
warning, along came the Wandering Wolf and
killed my older brother, and ate him up.</p>

<p>"Now, most unfortunately, my younger
brother was at town, making arrangements for
a good housekeeper when this happened, or he
would have been warned at least. But, do you
know, he had scarcely gone into his house and
closed the door when the dreadful huffing and
puffing started just outside his house! I heard
some noise over that way, but before I could find
out what had caused it, the wolf had finished his
dreadful work and was coming this way.</p>

<p>"My doors and windows were barred because,
living here alone in those days one had to be
very, very careful, so I just kept as still as I
could.</p>

<p>"I shook with fear and could scarcely keep
from crying out when he started jumping at
the door and huffing and puffing!</p>

<p>"Of course, he could not get in. So he changed
his plans. Why, Miss Pinky Pig, I can see his
wicked grin to this day! He tried time and time
again to catch me. And once when I was up in
an apple tree I nearly fell with fright when I
saw him below, glaring up at me. But I escaped,
as you see," Mother Grunty smiled.</p>

<p>"Didn't you once roll down the hill in a
churn?" asked Miss Pinky Pig.</p>

<p>"You bet she did," answered Blacky-ears, who
never could hear the tale often enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, finally,&mdash;and if you'll excuse me, I'll
take you out to the kitchen and prepare a bit of
supper while I finish my tale&mdash;finally, one day
the wicked Wandering Wolf grew beside himself
with rage and scrambled up onto this roof.
The old roof was of shingles, and it makes me
shiver even yet to remember how his heavy feet
scratched and clawed on the thin wood!</p>

<p>"Well, I was ready for him. I hung this same
old iron kettle over my roaring fireplace and&mdash;well,
do you know, I can never bear to tell anybody
what happened next. But until this day I
have never seen another wolf," she ended as they
seated themselves at the dainty table.</p>

<p>"I heard a wolf once," ventured Blacky-ears.</p>

<p>"Tell her about the time Blacky-ears was lost,
Mumsie," urged Little-wee Pig.</p>

<p>And so on and on they talked until Miss Pinky
Pig simply had to leave for home.</p>

<p>"And here I intended to talk school all the
time," said Mother Grunty as she helped Miss
Pinky Pig into her coat. "Won't you come back
again next Thursday?" And Miss Pinky Pig
said she certainly would.</p>
